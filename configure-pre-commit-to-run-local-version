In the pyproject.toml file. The entry file specified by the line

scripts.django-upgrade = "django_upgrade.main:main"

This tells us that django-upgrade is designed to be run as a command-line script, and the entry point is the main function within the django_upgrade.main module.  This is exactly what the pre-commit hook needs.

Correct .pre-commit-config.yaml (in Django project, where this package will run):  

  -   repo: /**/django-upgrade-agent # local path to the package
      rev: ""
      hooks:
      -   id: django-upgrade
          types: [python]
          args: [--target-version, "5.1"]

id: django-upgrade: This must match the name of the script defined in the pyproject.toml (scripts.django-upgrade).

types: [python]: It's a good practice to specify the types that the hook should operate on (in this case, Python files).
